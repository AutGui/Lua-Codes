## ðŸ“–Learning:

<br>

``` lua
-- Moving something on the explorer using :WaitForChild() and confirming it using :FindFirstChild() via script

local StarterPlayer = game.StarterPlayer
local StarterPlayerScripts = game.StarterPlayer.StarterPlayerScripts


StarterPlayerScripts:WaitForChild("Going to be moved")
print("It's here!")
local GoingToBeMoved = StarterPlayerScripts["Going to be moved"]
GoingToBeMoved.Parent = StarterPlayer


if StarterPlayerScripts:FindFirstChild("Going to be moved") then
	print("Still here!")

else print("Moved!")
end
```

<br>

This script waits for a script called `Going to be moved` to get into a folder called `StarterPlayerScripts`, when `Going to be moved` gets inside `StarterPlayerScripts` the script prints "It's here!" and moves it to the `StarterPlayer` folder. After that, it confirms if `Going to be moved` is still on `StarterPlayerScripts`, if so it prints "Still here!", if not it prints "Moved!".

<br>

Let's do this by steps:

``` lua
-- Moving something on the explorer using :WaitForChild() and confirming it using :FindFirstChild() via script
```

On line 1 I have a comment, it is not obligatory to place comments on scripts, I used it so I can understand what this script does, it does not affect the code, it's just like taking a note!

<br>

``` lua
local StarterPlayer = game.StarterPlayer
```

On line 3 I have a variable, I called it `StarterPlayer` and told the game that the variable represents a folder named `SarterPlayer` inside `game`. To make local variables you start by typing `local` followed by the name of the variable which I named `StarterPlayer`, after that use `=` to say what the variable is, variables can represent a lot of things, namely paths, which is what I used on this one, to do that you just write the path until you reach the file you want, for example, I wanted to reach the folder `StarterPlayer` which is inside `game` so I wrote `game.StarterPlayer`.


<br>

``` lua
local StarterPlayerScripts = game.StarterPlayer.StarterPlayerScripts
```

On line 4 I make a local variable called `StarterPlayerScripts` and tell the game that it represents a folder named `StarterPlayerScripts` that is inside `StarterPlayer` that is inside `game`.

<br>

``` lua
StarterPlayerScripts:WaitForChild("Going to be moved")
```

On line 7 I make my variable `StarterPlayerScripts`, that is a folder named `StarterPlayerScripts`, wait until it has a child named `Going to be moved`, after it waits, it lets the rest of the script do its job. To use `WaitForChild` put the variable that corresponds to a parent followed by `:`, after that write `WaitForChild`, open `()` and type the child inside, if it has a name don't forget to put `""` as well.

<br>

``` lua
print("It's here!")
```

On line 8 I make the game print `"It's here!"` on the console. Prints can be used to make sure the code is going through all steps.

<br>

``` lua
local GoingToBeMoved = StarterPlayerScripts["Going to be moved"]
```

On line 9 I make a new variable called `GoingToBeMoved`, the variable represents a script called `Going to be moved` that is inside the `StarterPlayerScripts`. Since the path to `StarterPlayerScripts` is already stored in a variable, there is no need to do `game.StarterPlayer.StarterPlayerScripts["Going to be moved"]`.

<br>

``` lua
GoingToBeMoved.Parent = StarterPlayer
```

On line 10 I tell the game that `GoingToBeMoved`'s parent is `StarterPlayer` making the game move the script `GoingToBeMoved` to the folder `StarterPlayer`.

<br>

``` lua
if StarterPlayerScripts:FindFirstChild("Going to be moved") then
	print("Still here!")

else print("Moved!")
end
```

On line 13 to 17 I tell the game that, if `StarterPlayerScripts` finds a child with the name `"Going to be moved"` inside of itself (picks the first one), then it shall print `"Still here!"`, else it shall print `"Moved!"`. `FindFirstChild` searches for the first child that is written inside the `()`. `FindFirstChild` is used by writing the variable that corresponds to the parent followed by `:`, then type `FindFirstChild`, put some `()` and write the child it will be searching for inside of it, if the child has a name don't forget to put `""` and type the child inside.

<br>

## Uses:

<br>

Why would you use this? Well, both `:WaitForChild()` and `:FindFirstChild()` are very useful, imagine you want to make the script do something the moment something is added to an other something, this is very useful, the script will wait until that something is added to the other something and then run the rest of the script, for example, you want that, when a button can now be clicked by the player, a message shows up on their screen telling them that the button is now clickable, in this situation you could use `:WaitForChild()` by using a child to symbolize that the button can now be clicked.
An example for `:FindFirstChild()` would be: you want a message to show up when a button can now be clicked, if a child that symbolizes that the button can now be clicked is found inside in a specific parent, it runs what is inside the `if`.
